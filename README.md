## My process

The requirements of the project were easy to list out since in the user side only one functionality was needed.
Beacuse this project requires basic understanding of async functions and HTTP request, I used axios to make requests
to the API

### Built with

- Axios
- Styled Components
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This project introduced me to styled components - a easy anf fast alternative to style react components
