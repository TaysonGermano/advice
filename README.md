## My process

The requirements of the project were easy to list out since on the user side only one functionality was needed.
Because this project requires a basic understanding of async functions and HTTP requests, I used Axios to make requests
to the API

### Built with

- Axios
- Styled Components
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This project introduced me to styled-components - an easy and fast alternative to style react components
